 2022: Took sender's excellent work and put it in an Excel sheet.
       Sheet has a macro to dump values to emacs-macro into this
       sheet. More consistency, fewer errors. Edit the sheet...

 Reworked by Sender 2021. Recognizing state of mud and implementation
 impacts of Darg's 2001 deployment, we decided to implement a much simpler
 version of weapon balancing. This may be an interim solution, but addresses
 a core problem. Relatively low player-base, decades of limiting zones to
 only having 1-2 VERY good items and the rest garbage, and a clear imbalance 
 between weapon types resulted in effectively having 3-4 weapons of the hundreds
 or thousands in the game used. Battle Axe was effectively the only two-handed 
 weapon worth using, and morning star the only one-handed.
 
 To that end, we've worked to make far fewer and more balanced categories of weapons.
 There is still a long-term desire to see weapons impacting armor types differently,
 but the attempt by Darg in 2001 was, in retrospect, either the wrong solution, or the
 right solution in the wrong context. Either way, it needs to be changed. 
 
 We've taken all weapons and grouped into new circles, and set the balance in the circles
 to be complete. The result is that a Battle Axe, hits exactly the same as Halberd, a
 War Mattock, and a Battle-Mace, etc. A long sword hits exactly the same as a broad sword,
 a war hammer, a morning star, etc. 
 
 Circles are shown here:
 
   1) Two-Handed "heavy" weapons:
	  Battle Axe, Claymore, Flamberge, Great Sword, Estoc, 
     Battle Mace, War Maul, Battle Club, Bastard Sword(2 hands),
	  War Mattock, Great Axe, War Axe, Maul, Trident, Scythe, Sickle

   2) Random Polearms:
	  Jeddart Axe, Bec De Corbin, Bill Guisarme, Lochaber Axe, Pilum, Halberd,
	  Pike, Voulge, Fauchard Fork, Partisan, Bardiche, "Lucerne 'Hammer" of Kai',
	  Gusarme, Foot Lance, Javelin, Ranseur, Lance, Military Fork, Gaff, Baculus.
	  Staff, Glaive, Pole Cleaver, Shock Lance, Spear, Fighting Staff, Pole Axe,
	  Shamir, Naginata, Quarter Staff, Fauchard, Spetum, Crowbill, Bill Hook
      
   3) One-Handed Normal Weapons:
	  Broad Sword, War Hammer, Ball and Chain, Morning Star, Cutlass,
	  hand axe, Kopesh, Flail, Fish Spine, Short Sword, Cudgel, Curved Sword, 
	  Long Sword, Machette, Bastard Sword(1 hand), Talwar,
     Cleaver, Wakizashi, Adze, Common Hammer, Katana, Rapier, Scimitar,

	  Main Gauche, Stiletto

   5) Ranged Weapons:

  See spells.def for most details. The damage tables determine the amount
  of damage given by each weapon. The following table shows how ALPHA
  (the third value) basically determines number of hits required before
  an opponent of equal status is killed (RTK is rounds to kill).
  However, the weapon skill can not be practiced above 100%, but this is
  compensated for by doing predictive calculations.

Formula for damage:

    A number list like this {50,30,5}, where the first number is the
    minimum amount required to roll to give damage. The second number
    is the base damage when successful, and the third is what the excess
    is divided by before it is added to the damage.

        if (roll >= num1)
           damage = num2 + (roll - num1)/num3

     'roll' is the total of dice rolls, resistances, bonuses, skills, etc.

# Format:
#   <zone> <pwd> <pri1> <pri2> <load> <pay> <path>
#
#   zone: name of the zonefile (on disk) not including .zon
#   pwd : not used by vme, used for FTP scripts if you have any
#   pri1: not used by vme (Probably used by a script)
#   pri2: access level of the zone. [0..255]
#         For certain DIL fields, e.g. PC_LIFESPAN if this value
#         is high enough then the field can be modified, otherwise
#         it can only be read. Generally it looks like the value
#         used is 1..10. 
#   load: Load level [200..255]. This field sets the level a wiz 
#         needs in order to load items from the zone.
#   pay : Pay only. [0..1]. Used if you have pay zones in the game.
#   path: This is the path to where data from this zone will be loaded / saved (DIL)

<pre>'cmdstr'
   This variable is a string which contains the "command" which was entered
   by a player. The result of adding:
</pre>
<pre>      cmdstr + " " + argument
</pre>
<pre>   is the entire string as entered by the player.
   The 'cmdstr' is EXPANDED by the interpreter, so assume a player
   types 's' then the string is expanded to 'south'.

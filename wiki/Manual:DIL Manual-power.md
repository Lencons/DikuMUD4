<pre>'power'
   This variable is an integer which can be reassigned. It is used in
   permission messages and in a few done messages. For example a permission
   request to damage a person with 100 damage would have power equal 100.
   This could then be reduced to 50 by assigning a new number.
   See description of messages for more information.

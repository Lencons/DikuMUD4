<p>	1. Create a door between the Disposal room and the main chamber
	of the station.  Make the new door pick-proof and magic-proof.
</p><p>	2. Create another hallway to the south of the main chamber that leads
	to a ship attached by an airlock.  You will need a door before the
	hallway and before the ship so no one gets sucked out in space.  You
	will need two more rooms for this one for the hallway and one for the
	ship.
</p><p>	3. Using the Dragon station zone as a guide create your own zone with
	eight  rooms.  Don't worry to much about descriptions and extras.  Link all
	eight of the rooms to each of the other rooms.  This means each room
	should have seven exits.  If you were to map this it would look like a
	cube marked with 'X' on the sides.

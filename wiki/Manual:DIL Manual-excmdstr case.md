<pre>'excmdstr_case'
   This variable is a string which contains the "first string" which was entered
   by a player. The result of adding:
</pre>
<pre>      excmdstr_case + " " + argument
</pre>
<pre>   is the entire string as entered by the player.
   The 'excmdstr' is not changed in anyway from how a player types it.
   If a player types 'S' then the 'excmdstr_case' will have 'S' in it.

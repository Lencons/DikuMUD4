<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Dice_Checks">Dice Checks</span></h2>
<p>In DikuMUD as in many other game systems, many checks for success or power of skills and spells are determined by dice rolls.
</p><p>An open-ended 1d100 roll (1d100OE) forms the basis for most checks. The open-ended rolls works like this:
</p><p>If you roll 96-100, roll again and add to the previous result (repeat if 96-100).
If you roll 1-5, roll again and subtract from the previous result (repeat if 96-100).
</p><p>A check is generally successful if: (skill + 1d100OE) &gt;= 100.
</p><p>For example, if your skill is 20, you would generally need to roll 80 or above for success.

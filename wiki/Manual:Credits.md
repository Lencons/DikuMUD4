<b>Original Zone Manual</b>
</p>
<ul><li>Andrew Cowan - One of the original administrators of Valhalla mud and now the administrator of the mud connector. Andrew created the first zone tutorial, which was later included into the vmc.txt to clear up some things missing in the old vmc.txt. Thanks go out to Andrew for his contributions not only to this document but to the growth of the DIL programming language.</li>
<li>Ryan Holliday - Made major updates to the tutorial.txt created by Andrew Cowan, which became version two of the tutorial.</li>
<li>Peter Ryskin - Wrote the original explanation of how to define exits.</li>
<li>John Clare - Made major updates to the tutorial.txt created by Andrew Cowan and updated by Ryan Holliday, which became version three of the tutorial.</li>
<li>Marc Bellemare - An editor and an author Marc combined and revised the tutorial and the vmc.txt into one document making it less Valhalla specific and more for any mud running the VME server.</li>
<li>Jennifer Garuba - Created the first document on how to create shop keepers. She also was one of the first builders to have the insite and to make it clear that a manual like this was needed.</li>
<li>Brian Spanton - Converted the original vmc.txt into HTMl, while at the same time fixing many inconsistencies and typos in it.</li>
<li>Kathy Perry - Wrote the original compiler howto to make it easier for new builders to compile their zone. She was also the first builder to open my eyes to the fact we needed a true manual on how to build.</li>
<li>Mark Pringle - Main editor.</li>
<li>Morgan Shafer - Wrote the guild definition primer which explained teachers.</li></ul>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Leveling_System">Leveling System</span></h2>
<p>This brief document describes the level system.
In general, 16,650 xp points = 1 level ( a little less until virtual level 50). 
</p>
<h3><span id="Players_(PCs)"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Players_.28PCs.29">Players (PCs)</span></h3>
<p>Players can be a level 0-255. For most practical purposes the delineation is usually between levels 0-49 and 50+.
Levels 200 to 255 are reserved for administrators (gods).
Thus, the gaming system allows players from level 0-199.
Players also have a virtual level (VLEVEL) which is essentially the amount of XP they've earned over the course of time or times they've typed&#160;: level now.
Current known limitation: at level 65,535, a player's experience counter rolls back over to 0 as does their level. 
The other level available is a guild level - that is the number of levels a character has done in a certain guild and does not reset when a player leaves the guild and rejoins.
</p>
<h3><span id="Non_Player_Characters_(NPCs)"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Non_Player_Characters_.28NPCs.29">Non Player Characters (NPCs)</span></h3>
<p>NPCs can be level 0-199. 
Odin the All Father of the Aesir is level 199.
Winky is level 33. 
Mary, the lumberjack's wife is level 16. 
Satan is level 199. 
Tiamat is level 195. 
An Udgaardian City Guard is level 62. 
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Abilities">Abilities</span></h2>
<p>Both PCs and NPCs have eight abilities STR (strength),DEX (dexterity) ,CHA (charisma) ,BRA (brain) ,MAG (magic) ,DIV (divinity), HPP (hitpoints), CON (constitution).
Abilities range from 0 - 250.  [Link to or pull in ability section]
For players the normal max for training abilities is [0..100] but no reason why you couldn't set it higher.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Practice_Points">Practice Points</span></h2>
<p>When you gain a new level you'll be awarded points to practice abilities, skills, and spells.
</p><p>For each level you'll be awarded:
</p>
<pre> Abilities = 10 * 4 through level 50&#160;? (2000 ability practice points in total per character lifetime)
 Skills &amp; Spells = 10 * 8 through unlimited levels. 
</pre>
<p>When your virtual level reaches 100, the cost of training slowly increases and maxes out at 200.
</p><p>The 10 is picked as the average cost of an ability or a skill (so it's important that's about the average cost in how the guilds are defined). The 4 is chosen because you have 8 abilities and you should be able to master at least half of your abilities.
</p><p>Each time you practice a skill, the skill increases in increments of 2. 
Each time you practice an ability the ability increases in increments of 1.

<h3><span id="Hit-points_&amp;_Regain"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Hit-points_.26_Regain">Hit-points &amp; Regain</span></h3>
<p>A PCs hit-points max is (3 * HPP + 20)
A NPCs hit-points max is (3 * HPP + 10)
</p><p><br />
A character regains hitpoints based on CON: (1 + hit max(CON) / 10)
If a character is fighting there is no hitpoint regain. Resting provides an 50% additional regain, while sitting is a 25% additional regain.
If a character is in a unit that has the UNIT_FL_SACRED set, the regain is furthermore doubled. 
If a player is thirsty or hungry the regain is reduced.
When a mortal character dies, their hitpoints are set to -1. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Mana">Mana</span></h3>
<p>The equation for max mana is: 100 + (BRA + CHA)/2 but never less than 200.
For a player, the max is further modified by the player's age compared to lifespan.
</p><p>The gain is 1 + MAX/10
Plus (CHA - the larger of(MAG, DIV) / 3)  [This is strange and should be reviewed]
</p><p>If a character is fighting there is no mana regain. Resting 50% additional regain, sitting 25% additional regain.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Endurance">Endurance</span></h3>
<p>Max endurance is a char's CON * 2 + 150.
For a player, the endurance is further modified by the player's age compared to lifespan.
The endurance regain equation is&#160;: 1 + endurance-max/10.
Regain is zero when fighting, an additional 50% if resting or sleeping, an additional 25% if sitting.
Furthermore doubled if in a unit with UNIT_FL_SACRED.
If a player is thirsty or hungry the regain is reduced.

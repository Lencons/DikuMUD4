<pre>  DIL features many other operators. For integers,
  '&lt;', '&gt;', '&lt;=', '&gt;=', '!=' '==' signify less than,
  greater than, less or equal, greater or equal, not equal,
  and equality operators. Furthermore, you can compare
  strings with '==' or '$=' for equality test, and '!='
  for non equality. Pointers may also use '==' and '!='
  and you may force DIL to compare pointers, even for
  strings with the '#=' pointer-equality operator.
  The '$=' and '#=' is considered obsolete, and only
  used for backward compatibility.

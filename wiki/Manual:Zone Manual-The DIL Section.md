<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_DIL_section">The DIL section</span></h2>
<p>	When I first thought of writing this manual I had planned to leave
	DIL totally out of it.  The DIL language always confuses new Builders
	and complicates teaching simple rooms, objects, and NPCs.  It became
	clear to me though that DIL is such a part of the server that I at least
	had to mention it hear so builders would know where to look and
	what DIL could do for them when they got to the point where they were
	ready to use it.
</p>
<h3><span id="What_is_DIL?"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="What_is_DIL.3F">What is DIL?</span></h3>
<p>	DIL is short for, Data-based instructional language.  Not to be
	confused with Database since DIL is nothing like a database.  Data-based
	means that the language works on a fixed set of units like objects,
	NPCS, and rooms and is designed to give them a life of their own.
	Unlike on many of the mud servers on the internet DIL is not an
	interpreted language it is a compiled language which gives you the user
	much more safe guards against crashes and slow code.
</p><p>	DIL also provides a full set of data types to allow you to do
	calculations or store information from players.  The DIL language can
	even deal with file access and it can add fields and information to the
	players if needed.  In short the VME server has its own internal
	functional language that will allow you to do just about anything you
	want to.

<h3><span id="What_can_DIL_be_used_for?"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="What_can_DIL_be_used_for.3F">What can DIL be used for?</span></h3>
<p>	...
</p><p>	It is hard to explain what all DIL can be used for with out just
	writing a list of things that have already been done in DIL so here is the
	list.
</p>
<ul><li>All spells</li>
<li>60% of the commands and skills and growing</li>
<li>Administrator commands</li>
<li>Movement commands</li>
<li>look commands</li>
<li>200+ quests and growing</li>
<li>Message boards</li>
<li>Mail system</li>
<li>Clan system</li>
<li>Automated Newbie guides</li>
<li>object restrictions</li>
<li>Death Sequence</li>
<li>Magical combat system</li>
<li>NPC agressive functions</li>
<li>personalized Familiars</li>
<li>personalized pets</li>
<li>Deck of cards</li>
<li>Chess board</li>
<li>dice</li>
<li>online AD&amp;D game playing system</li>
<li>Communication channels</li>
<li>automated wedding chapel</li></ul>
<p>Realize this is only a small list of things that can be done in
	DIL.  In the future we hope to be able to add the ability to easily
	change combat and all the character update features using DIL.  These
	things can be currently done with DIL but it takes a lot of knowledge
	and work which we hope to simplify.

<h3><span id="Where_do_I_get_more_information_on_DIL?"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Where_do_I_get_more_information_on_DIL.3F">Where do I get more information on DIL?</span></h3>
<p>	The online DIL reference guide is the most authoritative guide
	currently for DIL.  It can be found at
	<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.valhalla.com">http://www.valhalla.com</a> and follow the builders links.
</p><p>	In the near future we hope to have an entire new DIL manual that
	will teach, a person who has never coded all the way to people who are
	already professional coders, to use DIL.  For now if you can not find
	what you need in the DIL reference manual you can join the DIL email list
	at dil-request@valhalla.com or you can send a mail to
	whistler@valhalla.com.  Until and even after the new DIL
	manual is written we will always try to help you as much as possible
	while you are getting started.  It is important that you at least try
	and look through the DIL reference before asking a lot of questions
	because many of the questions may be answered already.
